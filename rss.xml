            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Google's Go Victory Is Just a Glimpse of How Powerful AI Will Be</h1><p>An artificially intelligent Google machine just beat a human grandmaster at the game of Go, the 2,500-year-old contest of strategy and intellect that's exponentially more complex than the game of chess.
